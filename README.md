# Minimum-Snap-Trajectory-Generation
Generate multiwaypoint minimum snap trajectory for the given boundaries

The purpose of the project is to generate a trajectory which minimizes snap(however, it can be easily modified to minimize velocity, acceleration, jerk and so on). The inputs are the sampled time points and boundaries. Square of the fourth derivative of the x is used as the cost functional. In order to minimize Euler-Langrange formulation is utilized.

Theory part has been added as images.
